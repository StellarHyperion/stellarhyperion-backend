/**
 * The Postgres handle, kept deliberately thin.
 *
 * There is no ORM here and there is not going to be one. The queries this service runs are a
 * handful of upserts keyed on a business identity and two or three claim style selects, and every
 * one of them reads better as the SQL it is than as a builder chain that compiles to it. What a
 * wrapper does buy is the one thing the correctness of the indexer rests on: a transaction helper
 * that cannot be forgotten, so writing a page of events and advancing the cursor that says the
 * page was written are the same commit.
 *
 * Rows come back as `Record<string, unknown>` rather than a generic the caller invents. pg does
 * not check the shape it returns against anything, so a generic there is a cast wearing a
 * costume. Narrowing happens once per table, in `rows.ts`, where it is visible.
