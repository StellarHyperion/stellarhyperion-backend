/**
 * EVM router logs mapped onto the shared row writers.
 *
 * The SQL is in `../writers.ts` and the per-event decisions are here. The one piece of real logic
 * in this file is the claim pairing: the router emits `ClaimParked` immediately before `BridgeIn`
 * in the same transaction when a delivery cannot be paid, and `BridgeIn` carries no flag saying so.
 * Reading a `BridgeIn` on its own would record every parked delivery as delivered, which is both
 * wrong and a check constraint violation waiting for the first frozen recipient.
