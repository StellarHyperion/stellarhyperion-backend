/**
 * Soroban events mapped onto the shared row writers, plus the cursor that says they are written.
 *
 * The SQL lives in `../writers.ts` because both chain families write the same tables under the
 * same constraints. What lives here is the part that is genuinely Stellar: which field of which
 * event becomes which column, and the three places where a Soroban event carries less than its
 * EVM counterpart and the row has to say so honestly rather than make something up.
 *
 * Every function takes a `Queryable` rather than the pool, so the watcher can hand it a
 * transaction. That is the whole restart safety claim: a page of events and the cursor advance past
 * it land together or not at all.
